I created a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

 1.-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

 2.-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement ( that is, remove other labels but mean and standard deviation)
  
 3.-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. (code book)
 
 4.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. (code book)

 5.- Finally, from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
